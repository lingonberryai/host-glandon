This is the genesis Host Tanaki.
All other Hosts are derived from Tanaki, our purest of heart and soul.
He is powered by HostOS®, a platform by Lingonberry Intelligence, Inc.

HostOS® allows humans to create and deploy embodied Hosts in a variety of venues.

A Host is made of a few key ingredients including
- 2D & 3D bodies
- A soul by @opensouls
- Keys to the internet
- Friendly endpoints for humans and robots to talk to

We'll keep some of him open and some closed source. This repository is open.

To boot up Tanaki, open a Terminal in the root of this folder and type
`npm run`

Have fun :)
